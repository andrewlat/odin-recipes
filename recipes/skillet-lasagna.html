            <li>1 pound hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (24 oz) jar RAGÚ Old World Style Traditional Sauce</li>
            <li>1 (9 oz) package no-boil lasagna sheets, broken into large pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary</li>
            <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese shredded and divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. 
                    Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, 
                    about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the RAGÚ Old World Style Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles, water, 
                    and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente.
                     Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine.
                     Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately. 
            </li>
        </ol>
